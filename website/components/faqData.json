    "question": "What is Untold Story?",
    "answer": "Untold Story is about sharing your real stories on dealing with alcohol. It’s about sharing the good, the bad and the ugly. It’s about sharing the stories that are often left untold."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why did we do this?",
    "answer": "We have been working collectively as a team to think on real world problems and their solutions. Once we saw the challenge in GovHack on improving health outcomes as well as using opendata for good. We found a beautiful message/pain point/ solution that will help so many."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is this anonymous?",
    "answer": "When going over the government data we found a potentially problem. Do people really want to admit to how much alcohol they are drinking? Generally the answer is no, this is why we worked to create this as being completely anonymous. While also showing the government what is really happening in Australia with alcohol consumption. We include verification in collecting this data to ensure it remains accurate and can only be entered once. This verification is done separately to our data collecting to remain truly anonymous."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's wrong with government data?",
    "answer": "The current National Drug Strategy Survey 2022 will only target 21,500 people, when the population of Australia is 25,422,788 people. How can you truly understand Australia without really asking the question to all?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is our data safe?",
    "answer": "With some of our team members studying Cyber Security, data security is a serious priority of ours. We have worked on this project with a secure by design from the beginning. There are some aspects we won't be implementing yet as we want to ensure the utmost safety of our data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is this design for people with an alcohol problem or their loved ones?",
    "answer": "This is designed for both. Inspired by the AA model that involves Alcoholics helping others. This site is about giving your experiences as an alcoholic, or giving your experiences as someone who has a loved one who is an alcoholic. This is created to be a shame free experience. If you know you have a problem, you don't need to be reminded about it or have shame pushed upon you."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should I help you by giving my data?",
    "answer": "The problem with the current government data is that it only reflects a small fraction of the population. This data is also collected by doctors/hospitals where people might not want to be upfront in fear of shame. We know Aussie's love to drink, it's everywhere. People will ask you why you're NOT drinking instead of why ARE you drinking. If we knew the real information on the amount people drink or how it effects them we can convey a message to the greater good on the problem that currently exists."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I contribute my story to Untold Story?",
    "answer": "Sharing your story on Untold Story is something we are working to make easy. Currently we have a quiz you can take to provide valuable information we can collect, it can be found on the home page by answering our 'Does Australia have a Drinking problem?' question. Or on our 'Do you know Aussies?' quiz page! We are working to integrate the ability to add your story but our security of information is our current priority to ensure this can be done safely."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of impact do you hope to achieve with Untold Story?",
    "answer": "Our goal is to create a comprehensive and accurate picture of alcohol consumption and its impact by gathering stories from a diverse range of people. With this data, we can advocate for better policies and resources that address the challenges of alcoholism, leading to improved health outcomes and a better understanding of the issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure the authenticity of the stories shared on Untold Story?",
    "answer": "We take data accuracy seriously. While maintaining anonymity, we have implemented a verification process to prevent duplicate entries and ensure the reliability of the data. This way, we can maintain the integrity of the information shared on the platform."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I access the data collected by Untold Story for research purposes?",
    "answer": "Our goal is for this data to be used by the Government for research/helpful purposes on how we can improve the culture around alcohol and help people."
